System  software  refers  to  the  low-level  software  that  manages  and  controls  a 
computer’s  hardware  and  provides  basic  services  to  higher-level  software. 
System software refers to the collection of programs and software components 
that enable a computer or computing device to function properly. It acts as an 
intermediary  between  the  user  and  the  computer  hardware,  allowing  the  user 
to interact with the hardware and use various applications and programs. 

System  software  is  a  type  of  computer  program  that  is  designed  to  run  a 
computer’s  hardware  and  application  programs  and  examples  of  system 
software  include  operating  systems  (OS)  (like  macOS,  Linux,  Android,  and 
Microsoft  Windows),  game  engines,  search  engines  (like  google,  Bing,  Yahoo!), 
industrial automation, computational science software, and (SaS)software as a 
service application. 

Operating systems (OS): Windows, Linux, macOS, etc. 

Device  drivers:  software  that  enables  the  communication  between  hardware 
and OS. 

Firmware:  pre-installed  low-level  software  that  controls  a  device’s  basic 
functions. 

Utility software: tools for system maintenance and optimization. 

Boot loaders: software that initializes the OS during startup. 

Why use System Software? 

Here are some reasons why system software is necessary: 

Hardware  Communication:  System  software  serves  as  an  interface  between 
the  hardware  and  software  components  of  a  computer,  enabling  them  to 
communicate and work together.

The  Instruction  Interpreter  Hardware  is  basically  a  group  of  circuits  that 
perform the operation specified by the instructions fetched from the memory. 

The  Location  Counter  can  also  be  called  as  Program/Instruction  Counter 
simply points to the current instruction being executed. 

The working registers are often called as the "scratch pads" because they are 
used to store temporary values while calculation is in progress. 

This CPU interfaces with Memory through MAR & MBR 

MAR (Memory Address Register) - contains address of memory location (to be 
read from or stored into) 

MBR (Memory Buffer Register) - contains copy of address specified by MAR 

Memory  controller  is  used  to  transfer  data  between  MBR  &  the  memory 
location specified by MAR 

The role of I/O Channels is to input or output information from memory. 

Components of a programming system 

Here are some components of system software: 

  Device drivers: Device drivers are software components that help the 

operating system and particular hardware devices communicate with one 
another. 

  Firmware:  This  is  a  system  software  embedded  within  the  hardware 
device.  It  controls  the  device  and  performs  functions  that  are  essential 
for  the  computer  system.  Firmware  is  stored  in  ROM  due  to  which  it 
cannot be modified or deleted. In some devices, firmware can be updated 
using updates from USB or the manufacturer’s device.

  Utilities:  Utility  software  is  a  program  specifically  designed  to  help 
manage  and  tune  system  or  application  software.  It  is  used  to  support 
the  computer  infrastructure  -  in  contrast  to  application  software,  which 
is aimed at directly performing tasks that benefit ordinary users. 

  Memory  management:  Memory  management  is  a  function  of  an 
operating  system  that  controls  and  coordinates  a  computer's  main 
memory.  It  ensures  that  blocks  of  memory  space  are  allocated  and 
managed  properly  so  that  the  operating  system,  applications,  and  other 
running  processes  have  the  memory  they  need  to  carry  out  their 
operations. 

  Data:  Data  is  a  collection  of  facts  or  measurements  that  has  been 
converted into a form that can be easily processed or moved. It can be in 
many forms, such as images, text, numbers, audio, or video.

Assemblers:  An  assembler  is  a  type  of  computer  program  that  takes  in  basic 
instructions  and  converts  them  into  a  pattern  of  bits  that  the  computer's 
processor  can  use  to  perform  basic  operations.  The  assembler's  job  is  to 
convert  assembler  or  assembly  language  code  into  machine  code  that  the 
computer can then read and execute. 

Linkers: A linker is a software tool that plays a crucial role in the compilation 
process  of  a  program.  It  takes  the  object  code  generated  by  the  compiler  and 
combines it with other necessary libraries and modules to create an executable 
file. 

Loaders: In computer systems a loader is the part of an operating system that 
is  responsible  for  loading  programs  and  libraries.  It  is  one  of  the  essential 
stages in the process of starting a program, as it places programs into memory 
and prepares them for execution.

Compilers: A compiler is a software program that converts a computer program 
written in a high-level programming language into machine language. 

Macros:  Macros  are  used  to  make  a  sequence  of  computing  instructions 
available  to  the  programmer  as  a  single  program  statement,  making  the 
programming task less tedious and less error-prone. 

Relocating loaders and dynamic linking loader designs. 

The basic architecture Loader:  

Source  program:  This  is  a  program  written  in  a  high-level  programming 
language that needs to be executed. 

Translator:  This  component  converts  the  source  program  into  an  object 
program. 

Object  program:  This  is  the  program  in  a  machine-readable  form,  usually  in 
binary, that contains both the instructions and data of the program.

Executable  object  code:  This  is  the  object  program  that  has  been  processed 
by the loader and is ready to be executed. 

Relocating loaders 

It  loads  a  program  at  any  memory  location,  and  then  adjusts  all  memory 
references  in  the  program  to  reflect  the  new  location.  This  allows  the  same 
program to be loaded into different memory locations without having to modify 
the program's object code 

Advantages of relocating loaders include:  

  They are simple to implement 
  They allow multiple programs or source programs written in different 

languages 

  The loader's task becomes simpler as it simply obeys the instruction 

regarding where to place the object code to the main memory 

  The process of execution is efficient

Dynamic linking loader designs 

  Dynamic loader loads only the required code a data by the program and 

leaves the rest part in the executable file 

  Dynamic loader resolves all the external dependencies and the entire 

process is known as dynamic linking. 

  Dynamic loading is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at 
run time, load a library into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions 
and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access 
those variables, and unload the library from memory. 

  Dynamic loading is utilized to ensure optimal memory consumption. In 

dynamic loading, a routine is not loaded until it is invoked.
